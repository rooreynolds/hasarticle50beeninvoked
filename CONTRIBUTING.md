## Updates

When (or if) article 50 is invoked, a timely [update to the index file](https://github.com/rooreynolds/hasarticle50beeninvoked/edit/master/index.html) changing the 'no' to a 'yes' would be especially helpful.

Please include a link to some evidence that article 50 has indeed been invoked in the description field when making your change.

Thank you.
